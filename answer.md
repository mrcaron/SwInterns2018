# Project Description
The topic of my choice is checking if a given string is a palindrome. Based on the prompt, I have created two separate programs with simple and more complex functionalities.

## Running The Project
To compile all the cpp files for the project, cd into the directory and type:
```{bash}
make all
```
To compile only the simple program, type:
```{bash}
make check
```
To compile only the complex program, type:
```{r}
make enhanced-check
```
To run either one of the programs, type:
```{bash}
./check ./enhanced-check
```
