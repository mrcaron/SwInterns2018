# SOLIDWORKS 2019 Summer Comp-Sci Internships
We're excited that you want to join our team at SOLIDWORKS! This is a code repository hosted by GitHub (if you're new to git or github, read [the getting started guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)) containing an exercise or two for you to complete prior to our first talk. It gives us some material for conversation.

Please [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repo and create a branch for yourself. Solve one (or more!) of the problems below in the _Choose your own adventure_ section. When you're done, [create a pull request for us](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). Write clearly, write correctly. State any assumptions you make. We look forward to chatting over your code! 

If you have any questions along the way, feel free to create an Issue on this repository and tag me and I'll answer it asap.

## Choose Your Own Adventure

The following are fairly simple programming exercises. You can choose whatever you like to solve and solve it in whichever language you like. You can submit two answers, one that just gets the job done and the second one that is a more complete experience. Think about the interaction you might need or the output it generates, how could you display it? Is a command line experience sufficient? Should you make a webpage? A native app? The first solution should take just a few minutes, the second one depends on how you decide to go.

* Check if a String is a palindrome or not
* Split a string into parts based off a given character
