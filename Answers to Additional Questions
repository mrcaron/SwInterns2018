Agile reminds me of my last summer internship. I worked on a team using a agile scrum product implementation framework.
Also, it makes me think of writing a lot of code really quickly and updating versions quickly.

DevOps reminds me of software engineering as a whole. Specifically, it makes me think of the software engineers at the
bottom of the food chain, but everyone has to start at the bottom.

C++ reminds me of freshman year of high school. I took a semester long class then; it was my second experience with
progamming. But, it was the first where I was exposed to some of the more complicated topics.

Internship reminds me what I hope to find in Madison this summer. I want to stay in Madison and work in software to learn
valuable new skills and have a great time.
