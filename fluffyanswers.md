Before I answer additional questions, I just want to say I'm not quite sure about crashing my program, so I did not do that one.

Agile to me is a way of software development, which makes development fast, aka agile.

DevOps to me is a good way of communication and cooperation attitude between departments within an corporation.

C++ to me is a programming language similar to C, which is my answer language. I heard it's object-oriented. So I suppose it's also similar to JAVA. Never used C++ but always heard of it.

Internship to me is a valuable experience which by far I haven't had and would love to have. My major is electrical engineering and computer science. Both are very practical fields. So I've always been eager to achieve an internship so that I can apply what I've learned in real life and bring some changes to the world.
