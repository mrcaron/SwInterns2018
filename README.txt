For a complete user experience, I decided to build a web app that allows the users to input strings/JSON
texts and visualizes the result of the following three problems:
- reverse a string
- check if a string is palindrome
- print out a JSON object

At first, I wrote a Java program that interacts with users through command line. After considering
some potential use cases of the program, I think it fits the web technology better. I used jQuery
and Bootstrap 4 in the project. I haven't been doing web development for a while, so I did lots of
googling and research to refresh my memory while writing the app. I enjoyed the learning process.

The web app consists of three files:
1) index.html
2) index.js
3) index.css

To run the app, please put all of the three files in the same directory and open index.html in Chrome.
Internet connection is required for running the app, as I use the jQuery and Bootstrap 4 hosted remotely.

My answers to the additional questions:
- You say "Agile", I think "teamwork, scrum, rapid release cycle"
- You say "DevOps", I think "design, development, testing, collaboration"
- You say "C++", I think "infrastructure, backend, efficiency"
- You say "internship", I think "exploration, learning, communication"
