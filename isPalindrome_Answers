For part 2: 

I say "Agile", you think...
I think about a fast way for developing.
I say "DevOps", you think...
I think about developing operation.
I say "C++", you think...
I think about it is a higher level language compared to C but it could also be considered as a low level language since it's also abstract.
I say "Internship", you think...
I think about I may be a great candidate for this opportunity.
