You say "Agile", I think of an efficient process for small teams to get maximum work done under a tight schedule. 

You say "DevOps", I think of someone who is underrated in the industry but is integral to the fundamental working of any technology based product. 

You say "C++", I think of a high level language with the power of OOP coupled with the speed of a low level language resulting in the best of both worlds.

You say "Internship", I think of an opportunity to learn, grow, and build relationships to ultimately become a better version of myself.
